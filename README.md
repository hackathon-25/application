Introduction:
Problem: what makes us to lead the waste managem

Polina’s notes on
What PROBLEM are we trying to solve?
	Improper waste disposal 
	Why is it a problem? How does that harm our planet?
	What are consequences of improper waste disposal?

“Ontario has a waste problem; every year, Ontario produces nearly one tonne of waste per person and three-quarters of [this waste] ends up in landfills.”

“Although switching to environmentally conscious methods of waste reduction (like composting or recycling) is encouraged, a vast amount of recycled waste still ends up in landfills. The reason for this is that people are recycling wrong with contaminated and non-recyclable objects ending up in the wrong bin.”

Again: a vast amount of recycled waste still ends up in landfills.

Say what happens with each kind of waste, specified by a bin. How that waste is process further.
Then say what happens when you put wrong staff into wrong bins.

BLACK vs GREEN
When you put food scraps into a black bin instead of a green one, food scraps, are buried at the landfill where they decay and cause global warming pollutions.

Hi! Have you ever wondered what happens with items after you throw them away?

Black bin iteams are buries at the landfills.
Green bin items

Have you ever wondered what happens when you put a wrong item into a blue bin?

Solution
Insert basic explanation for the solution:


Rewards system (3 parts)

Users are rewarded :

For putting items into correct bins.
If users put an item into a right bin, they are rewarded with relevant points.
Green 5 points
Papers 4 points
Recycles 3 points
Glasses 2 points
Garbage 1 point
If users put an item into a wrong bin, they will be penalized by losing 10 points
Based on the personalized goals
If users exceeded the limit (calculated based on the number of people leave together), they lose half of the points earned last month
If users did better than their history, depends on how well they did they will earn more points.
If users performance was worse than themselves and better than the limit, they are not rewarded more points.
For the successful challenges, they have participated in
For example, if they do not make a mistake for a week they will be given more points 

Redemption system 
Users are motivated to use the device by the presence of rewards. For this reason, every 100 points are considered as a dollar and users can use them in different ways: 
Gift cards

Education part: 
The device ( set of bins and camera and sensors ) has a monitor that allows users to log in to their account and to earn points based on their performance. 
The device not only shows where the recognized object has to go but also print out informative messages.
